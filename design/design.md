There are two new activities I'd like you to create for two players to play using a  single iPad: 

1)  A word is displayed just for kid A to see (kid A holds it close to himself), and kid A says it orally.  Then kid A clicks a done button and puts the ipad on the table for both to see.  Now there will be 4 word choices on it.  Kid B picks the word he thinks kid A said.  The device then indicates whether the pair was correct, and sounds out the answer (and the incorrect answer if there is one -- if its an onset/rime word, it will break the words into their onset and rimes first ast they sound them out.)

2)    Partner reading of stories, where each kid first picks a color, and then reads the text when it turns his color.    The text color would usually switch after each sentence, but to keep the kids on their toes, sometimes the text color would be the same for two consecutive sentences, and sometimes (but rarely) would switch colors after only a few words in the sentence.   The kids reading could be recorded for the teacher to listen to later. You can use a Stage 4 story for the first iteration of this activity.
